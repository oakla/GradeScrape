# GradeScrape

A script that will scrape your grades, from a pdf of your academic transcript, into a csv file.

## Background
When I was last studying at university, there were so many subjects I wanted to take but which didn't fit into the standard structure of my chosen degree (BSci). I got around this by starting several 'dummy degrees'. (Taking all these extra units is how I ended up with a BPhil, but that's another story.) 

The point is, after graduation, when I wanted to know my 'real' GPA, I couldn't find it on my academic transcript. Instead, it listed a separate GPA for each degree I started, which only included the grades for the subjects I started that under that degree, even if those grades were eventually transferred to one of the degrees I actually completed.  

I wanted to know two things:
1. My GPA for each degree (based on the units credited to that degree), and
2. My overall GPA

Of course, I could have done this manually in a few minutes, but instead I spent several hours building a website to do it for me because "[I'm a programmer, and that's what we do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USKD3vPD6ZA&t=377s)", and maybe someone else would find it useful.
